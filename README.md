<h1>t-SNE and 2D LDA on MNIST Data Set</h1>
<p>In this repository first information was given about the MNIST data set to be 
worked on. Afterwards, information was given about t-SNE and LDA, which are the two 
subjects of this project (you can acces it from pdf file), and about its mathematical background. Then, the 
multidimensional MNIST data set was reduced to two dimensions and visualized with t-SNE 
using the Python programming language. After that, the other topic, linear discriminant analysis 
examined. The MNIST data set was reduced to two dimensions and visualization was 
performed with LDA. And then you can get classification with the test data set and the 
accuracy value with running the codes. </p>

<h2>About MNIST Data Set</h2>
  <p>The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a large database of handwritten digits 
    that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.The data set contains 70,000 small images of digits 
    handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau. Each image is labeled with the digit it represents.
  There are 70,000 images,
    and each image has 784 features. This is because each image is 28 × 28 1pixels, and each feature simply represents one pixel’s intensity, from 0 (white) to 255 (black).</p>
